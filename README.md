# tensorstore_cpp

This is a C++ repository which uses bazel and [tensorstore](https://github.com/google/tensorstore)

To create your own bazel + TensorStore C++ library you can start with the `WORKSPACE` and `.bazelrc` files
in this repository.  No guarantees that they will always use the latest tensorstore release, though.
